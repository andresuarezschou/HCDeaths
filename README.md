# HCDeaths

This addon displays and logs hardcore deaths.   
You can move the toast or log by holding ctrl and shift and dragging.    
You can reset the toast or log position by holding ctrl and shift and right clicking.

- /hcd log scale num - sets the death log scale to num

The original addon was designed to retrieve the information of the fallen player using the /who ingame system.
Since they limited the search function I found this way to work around it and it can now display consecutive deaths without crashing.
